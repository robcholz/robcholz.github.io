- Computer Engineering student at NC State, obsessed with making ideas move.
- From Arduino to ESP32 to Rust async, still chasing that spark between hardware and imagination.
- Now building Pixu, a playful system experiment on how the real world can respond like software.
- Loves firmware, system design, and anything that glows or moves.
- Addicted to Latte, midnight commits, and the idea of soldering imagination into reality.
- Love both acoustic & electric guitar, and learning vlogging right now
